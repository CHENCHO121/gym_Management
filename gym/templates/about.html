                    Gym and Fitness was founded in 2002 as a family owned and operated business. The Gym and Fitness
                    founders didn’t want it to be just another gym equipment retailer - they wanted to be the best in
                    the industry and set their minds to doing so! Since its birth, Gym and Fitness has grown into one of
                    Australia’s largest online fitness equipment retailers having helped over 50,000 customers live
                    longer, happier and healthier lives.
